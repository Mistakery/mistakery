# Mistakery

Browser game about a startup trying to find its first paying customer. Open `index.html` directly; the game needs no server or build step.

The project site will be available at [mistakery.github.io/mistakery](https://mistakery.github.io/mistakery/) after GitHub Pages is enabled for this repository. Add `?story=live-agent` to open the Live AI Agent route directly for testing.

## Source of truth

- `cards.json` holds the game deck and English copy. `cards.bundle.js` is its generated offline copy.
- `MISTAKERY_CARDS_EN_RU.md` is the generated bilingual catalog.
- `docs/core/` holds current world, character, tone, and rejected-pattern guidance. The character source PDF is in `docs/source/`.
- `assets/*.webp` are used by the game. The three Padel/CEO PNGs are high-resolution image originals; Phosphor icon attribution is in `assets/icons/PHOSPHOR-LICENSE.txt`.

After changing the deck or runtime, run `node scripts/build-offline-deck.cjs`. After changing card copy or translations, also run `node scripts/build-card-catalog.cjs`.

## Checks

Use Node.js 20 or newer. Run `npm ci`, then `npm run test:unit` for the fast data and runtime checks. Install the Playwright browsers with `npx playwright install chromium webkit`, then run `npm test` for all current checks, including browser coverage.
